# PPF
Public Provident Fund (PPF) calculation based on custom/real transactions and variable interest rates

**Why?** If transactions to the PPF are available, then this code can find the current balance, no need of interent, or logging in to bank/postoffice account to get details.

- Basic calculation is added.
- withdrawl and other rules are not enforced to error as code does not include checking.

Customisation such as error, feature addition etc. to the codes are more than welcome.
